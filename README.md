## Quick start
This is a normal flutter app. You should follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install).
This project uses **BLoC** (business logic component) to separate the business logic with UI itself and uses **Modularization** approach to separate each modules.
It's recommended to do self-study about it in here (BLoC: [here](https://bloclibrary.dev/), Modularization: [here](https://medium.com/flutter-community/mastering-flutter-modularization-in-several-ways-f5bced19101a) and [here](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_modular)).


## Modularization Structure üî•

    # Root Project
    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features               # Name of directory
    |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature A          # Feature module with a clean architecture inside it.
    |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature B
    |   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature etc
    |
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib                    # Name of module (default from Flutter)
    |
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ libraries              # Name of directory
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core               # Core module.
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dependencies       # Handle dependency version updates.
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared             # Handle common utility class and custom widget.


## Clean Architecture Flow (Feature Module) üî•

## Built With üõ†
* [Modularization](https://medium.com/flutter-community/mastering-flutter-modularization-in-several-ways-f5bced19101a) with [flutter_modular](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_modular) packages  - Separate functionality into independent, interchangeable modules.
* [Equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) - Being able to compare objects in `Dart` often involves having to override the `==` operator.
* [Json Serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) - Builders for handling JSON.
* [Dio](https://github.com/flutterchina/dio/) - A type-safe HTTP client.
* [BLoC Pattern](https://bloclibrary.dev/) - Business logic component to separate the business logic with UI.
* State - (Loading, No Data, Has Data, No Internet Connection, Request Timeout, Error)
* [Flutter Screenutil](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_screenutil) - Responsive UI.
* [Flavor](https://medium.com/@animeshjain/build-flavors-in-flutter-android-and-ios-with-different-firebase-projects-per-flavor-27c5c5dac10b) - Handling different environments for development and production.
* [Localization](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_localization) - Easy to change language between English and Indonesian.

## How to run the App
1. Clone this project.
2. Open with your favorite tools editor.
3. Run `Pub get` on each module sequentially starting from `dependencies` and ends `your root project` to generated `pubspec.lock` file.
4. Generated `*.g.dart` file in `list_news` module. But before you running that, make sure go to [list_news](https://github.com/rrifafauzikomara/NewsApp/tree/master/features/list_news) module first using `cd` command. For example `cd features` and then `cd list_news`. Then you can run this command: `flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`.
5. Run the App using [this](https://github.com/rrifafauzikomara/NewsApp#run-the-app-using-command-prompt) or [this](https://github.com/rrifafauzikomara/NewsApp#run-the-app-using-green-button). Enjoy your App!.


## Run the App using command prompt
Development
```console
flutter run --flavor development --target=lib/ui/launcher/main-dev.dart
```
Production
```console
flutter run --flavor production --target=lib/ui/launcher/main-prod.dart
```
