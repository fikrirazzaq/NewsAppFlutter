## Quick start
This is a normal flutter app. You should follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install).
This project uses **BLoC** (business logic component) to separate the business logic with UI itself and uses **Modularization** approach to separate each modules.
It's recommended to do self-study about it in here (BLoC: [here](https://bloclibrary.dev/), Modularization: [here](https://medium.com/flutter-community/mastering-flutter-modularization-in-several-ways-f5bced19101a) and [here](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_modular)).

## Built With üõ†
* [Modularization](https://medium.com/flutter-community/mastering-flutter-modularization-in-several-ways-f5bced19101a) with [flutter_modular](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_modular) packages  - Separate functionality into independent, interchangeable modules.
* [Equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) - Being able to compare objects in `Dart` often involves having to override the `==` operator.
* [Json Serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) - Builders for handling JSON.
* [Dio](https://github.com/flutterchina/dio/) - A type-safe HTTP client.
* [BLoC Pattern](https://bloclibrary.dev/) - Business logic component to separate the business logic with UI.
* State - (Loading, No Data, Has Data, No Internet Connection, Request Timeout, Error)
* [Flutter Screenutil](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_screenutil) - Responsive UI.
* [Flavor](https://medium.com/@animeshjain/build-flavors-in-flutter-android-and-ios-with-different-firebase-projects-per-flavor-27c5c5dac10b) - Handling different environments for development and production.
* [Localization](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_localization) - Easy to change language between English and Indonesian.

## How to run Flutter App
### Generated `*.g.dart` file
Before run the app, make sure to generate `*.g.dart` file, you can use this command on terminal. But before you running that, make sure go to [list_news](https://github.com/rrifafauzikomara/NewsApp/tree/master/features/list_news) feature module first using `cd` command. For example `cd features` then `cd list_news`. Then you can run the command below.

One time build:
```console
flutter pub run build_runner build
```
or you can watch for changes and rebuild automatically
```console
flutter pub run build_runner watch
```


### Run Flutter with command prompt
Development
```console
flutter run --flavor development --target=lib/ui/launcher/main-dev.dart
```
Production
```console
flutter run --flavor production --target=lib/ui/launcher/main-prod.dart
```


### Run Flutter with green button
Just follow this [instruction](https://github.com/rrifafauzikomara/MovieApp#run-flutter-app-between-flavor-for-development-and-production-with-).
